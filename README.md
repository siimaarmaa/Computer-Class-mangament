# Project Computer Class mangament
I started a specific project in 2014 while doing an internship at Antsla Gymnasium. The aim of the project was to create a lesson plan for two computer cats, so to speak. What can be seen by both students and teachers. The specific project was to achieve the goal where it would be possible for the teacher to add the desired lessons to a free space in the computer class and remove them if the lesson were to be missed. Everything should have worked so that the other teacher could not remove the things added by the other teacher, but could only remove the administrator. Unfortunately, the specific project has stalled.
